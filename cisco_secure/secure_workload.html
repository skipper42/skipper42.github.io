    <h2>Key Differentiators and Strength of Cisco Secure Workload</h2>
    <h3>1. Unified Solution for Micro-Segmentation</h3>
    <p>
      CSW offers agent-based and agentless microsegmentation for bare metal,
      virtual machines, and containers; located on-premise, in hybrid, or
      multi-cloud environments. All of this done through single platform and
      through single UI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agent Based covers: Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Servers, Linux (RHEL,
      Oracle, Ubuntu, AWS Linux, Centos, Debian, SUSE, Alma and Rocky), RHEL and
      SUSE on IBM Power and IBM z/Systems, AIX, Solaris (Solaris 11.4 on x86_64
      and SPARC architectures), Kubernetes, OpenShift, AKS, EKS, and GKE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agentless approach: through native integration with Cisco Secure Firewall,
      F5 and Citrix ADCs, Firewall Orchestrators (AlgoSec, Tufin and Skybox),
      Security Groups in AWS, NSGs in Azure, GCP built-in firewall.
    </p>
    <h3>2. NVIDIA Bluefield Data Processing Units (DPU)</h3>
    <p>
      Cisco Secure Workload and NVIDIA DPU integration allows the offloading of
      Secure Workload Agent functionality from hosts to Nvidia Bluefield DPUs.
      This integration will enhance application performance, scalability, and
      administrator productivity. The agent deployed on the DPUs gathers the
      flow telemetry and enforces the policy on the DPU to achieve
      microsegmentation.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Extensive labeling and robust orchestration ecosystem</h3>
    <p>
      CSW follows an automation-first approach, offering a range of integrations
      for workload inventory/metadata ingestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It supports 32 manual labels along with unlimited labels from
      orchestrators/automation.
    </p>
    <p>Automated Context Ingestion through native integration with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ServiceNow</li>
      <li>Cisco ISE and Active Directory</li>
      <li>DNS Servers & Infoblox</li>
      <li>VMware vCenter</li>
      <li>Public cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP</li>
      <li>
        Kubernetes environments: Managed K8s - AKS, EKS, OpenShift and unmanaged
        K8s
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This allows us to construct logical groups for policy, which are dynamic
      and evolve with the ongoing change in the customer environment. In
      addition, CSW automatically discovers, and groups, workloads together
      based on their role within the application. There is no requirement for
      CMDB integration or manual effort from engineers to provide additional
      label information for server types. CSW analyzes live traffic flows across
      various applications, regardless of if they connected to the virtual or
      physical fabric allowing for a sizable and complex ADM with intra and
      inter dependencies and communications.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Flexible and Hierarchical Policy Model</h3>
    <p>
      Hierarchical Policy: Cisco Secure Workload allows breaking the policy into
      smaller subsets of rules such as "Shared Service Rules” and “App Specific
      Rules”. Secure Workload allows you to build an Organizational Structure
      and customize it in a way that meets your organization needs. Using
      inventory Labels, we can break down an IP scheme of an organization into
      manageable blocks called scopes. Scopes are organized in a tree structure,
      with a Root Scope at the top of the tree which represents all IP
      addresses; both internal and external. Each leaf of the scope tree is tied
      to a query, with the queries typically being more broad at the higher
      levels of the tree and becoming more specific as you traverse down the
      tree structure until at the bottom of the tree we are matching workloads
      that are specific to an application. Scopes provide a hierarchy and
      structure to the inventory which will be useful for assigning policies and
      user roles for each of these blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows user to create very broad policy to represent corporate policy
      by applying it at Root level. for example “Dev can’t talk to Prod”. At
      next level you can define one or more "Shared Services Rules" that are
      common across the organization or across a particular location or
      environment, such as DNS, Active Directory once in the higher level scope
      and have those policies applied across all workloads. while applying
      policy that is required specifically for the application to function at
      the lower-level application scopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this scope hierarchy, policy can be applied at any level of the tree
      and will be collapsed into a single policy that will be applied on
      matching workloads.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSW supports both Allow and Deny policy actions and it has unified view of
      all allow and deny rules on a per-application basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others don’t support hierarchal model and they are using whitelisting
      methodology, the absence of any rule to allow traffic implies traffic must
      not be allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not feel the limitation of whitelisting methodology in beginning
      of deployment or while you are testing the micro segmentation solution in
      your environment. But we live in a nonideal world, exceptions and risk
      acceptance are part of any business, so we need to make sure that the
      micro segmentation solution supports all business cases that we currently
      have and what we may have in future. We should be able to allow and deny
      policies similar to way we are currently do on firewalls, also we should
      be able to use all possible attributes to build the required policies.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Host based microsegmentation leveraging OS native tools</h3>
    <p>
      Secure Workload primarily enforces using the operating system firewall
      capabilities of the workload via an agent deployed to the workload
      operating system. These agents orchestrate the policy using IP sets and
      iptables in Linux-based servers (including Kubernetes nodes) and either
      Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) or Windows Advanced Firewall (WAF)
      security functions in Microsoft Windows servers. Without the need to
      install proprietary host firewall that introduces the following risks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Proprietary host firewall is inline with traffic, making it a point of
        failure and may impact the running applications
      </li>
      <li>
        Proprietary host firewall can be running in Kernel space firewalling -
        Kernel Intrusive: The agent has a direct kernel hook
      </li>
      <li>
        Proprietary host firewall requires reboot with installation, uninstall
        and update
      </li>
      <li>
        Proprietary host firewall may cause kernel crash for compatibility
        issues or when OS is patched or updated
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>6. Intelligent Policy Generation</h3>
    <p>
      AI/ML powered intelligent policy generation: Unsupervised Machine Learning
      for application dependency mapping, while others leverage templates,
      manual configuration of groups and limited environment automated grouping,
      CSW can automatically discover ANY application exactly the way that a
      customer has deployed. This is because CSW leverages advanced machine
      learning techniques for discovery. This significantly improves the
      accuracy and granularity of the policy that CSW discovers over others. ADM
      has no hard dependency on manual tags and can look at the flows & workload
      behavior to intelligently identify workload groupings. ADM can be
      fine-tuned to generate coarse policies for ringfencing or fine policies to
      microsegment down to each unique workload.
    </p>
    <p>ADM can be fine-tuned to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate coarse policies for ringfencing or fine policies</li>
      <li>
        Generate granular micro-segmentation policies unique to each workload
      </li>
      <li>Exclude conversations that match specific filters</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>7. Behavior Anomaly Detection</h3>
    <p>
      CSW supports process and network behavior anomaly detection, it builds
      baseline that provides insight into process identification, parameters,
      associated users, start times, and hash information. Then applies behavior
      analysis and statistical models incorporate with MITRE ATT&CK techniques
      to identify and track behavior pattern changes and determine exposure.
    </p>
    <h3>8. Native Vulnerability Scanning</h3>
    <p>
      CSW has native vulnerability scanning and it does not require any
      integrations with third-party vulnerability scanners, which allows build
      policies based on vulnerability CVE-IDs.
    </p>
    <h3>9. Native integration with Cisco Vulnerability management</h3>
    <p>
      Cisco Vulnerability Management uses proven data science techniques,
      including machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive
      modeling to assess, prioritize, and even predict risk. CSW allows to build
      a network-based policy based on Vulnerability Security Risk Score such as
      active internet breach, easily exploitable, fix available and malware
      exploitable, ...etc.
    </p>
    <h3>10. Virtual Patching</h3>
    <p>
      Secure Workload agents collects CVE data from workloads and push CVE
      information from Cisco Secure Workload to Cisco Secure Firewall Management
      Center to augment the threat protection capabilities of the firewalls to
      protect the workloads from known vulnerabilities and provide virtual
      patching as a compensating control using the IPS signatures on the
      firewall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature may help user to automate IPS policy review task as CSW
      collects the existing vulnerabilities and Cisco FMC/Firewall/NGIPS will
      activate the required IPS signatures.
